# Side
- When the project scales i will use node, and compare both of them, also maybe i will use tsc&&tsc-alia
- compare solutions and ideas between gpt and gemini
- use aider for basic things, not for big chunks of code or huge rewrites
- compare bun vs node , as bun started supporting express, doest support remix though?


 need to integrate MCPs in aider
- use Figma MCP for converting design into code (just some of it)
    - TODO: I need to provide my figma api to mcpm
-
- look for how to give aider a really only file to know what are the practices of the project
- using bun for  running react router with vs using it with ssr React router
- Prepare code for the express structure
- Add the brave search mcp or equivalent for the search support as we are using latest tech
- auth js
    - can i use it with in the Backend not just the Frontend
    - is it a good idea to just use it in  one of them
    - do i just use Auth in the back with minimal validation on the front
