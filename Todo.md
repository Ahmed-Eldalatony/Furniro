## Backend
- express 5 (with dto and good ts stucture)
- sqlite

## Shared
- gemini 2.0 flash for fast, not nesserly good code. 
- zod (how to share a schema between back and frontend)
- biome linter and formatter
- ts 7 with (go rewrite)
- Prisma
- vitest

- auth js
    - can i use it with in the backend not jus the frontend
    - is it a good idea to just use it in  one of them
    - do i just use auth in the back with minimal validatoin on the front
# Side
- compare solutions and ideas between gpt and gemini
- use aider for basic things, not for big chunks of code or huge rewrites
- compare bun vs node , as bun started supporting express, doest support remix though?
